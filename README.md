# LED-Distance-indicator
This project utilizes an Arduino microcontroller and an ultrasonic sensor to create a distance indicator using LEDs. The LEDs will light up gradually based on the proximity of an object to the sensor. Closer objects will light up more LEDs, indicating shorter distances, while farther objects will light up fewer LEDs.
